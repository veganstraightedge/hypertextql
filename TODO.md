# TODO list

Temporarily in Markdown file in repo because my network connectvity is intermittent at the moment.
All of these will get extracted to GitHub Issues in the repo.

- document html for database tables
  - `table` for tables,
  - `caption` for descriptions,
  - `th` for column names,
  - `tr` for rows,
  - `td` for column in a row,
  - `a` tags for foreign keys/association references
  - consider what native HTML attributes are useful
  - consider what `aria-*` attributes are useful
  - augment those native HTML attributes with `data-*` attributes
- write an HypertextQL spec document
- write automated specs for that spec document

- consider an HypertextQL schema format
  - like rails' `db/schema.rb` / `db/structure.sql` file
  - `HypertextQL::Schema`
